Originally  aimed  at studying  climatic change impacts on dry mountain grassland, the measuring activities have been strongly  expanded  throughout  the  years.    Today's activities on the site include process-oriented  ecological  research covering time (historical analysis, actual processes and future scenarios ) and space (from plot to landscape scale among different ecosystems) within a human-influenced catchment.  \r\nThe  valley  is  situated  in  the  central  Alps  in the westernmost part of South Tyrol in North Italy. Matsch is a side valley of the Vinschgau valley, and extends over 90 km2 reaching  from  950 m.a.s.l.  to  3700 m.a.sl.  at  the highest peak. The main village Matsch is located at 1600 m and has 458 inhabitants.Due to its protected location in the central Alps, the Mazia/Matsch valley represents one of the driest spots within the whole alpine range, with a mean annual precipitation of 525mm at 1500m.a.s.l  (1950-2010) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
