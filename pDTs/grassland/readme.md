## FAIRness of the Grassland pDT

This page features information about how the BioDT project made the Grassmind model (https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=48444) as well as its input data Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

Steps taken:
* eLTER grassland data was collated and published on B2Share (https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/?q=keywords.keyword%3D%27BioDT%20AND%20Grassland%20pDT%27&size=100)
* A static description was written to describe the Grassmind model
* A script utilising the ROCrate python package (https://pypi.org/project/rocrate/) was written to automatically generate ROCrates for datasets on B2Share related to the pdT (keywords "BioDT" and "Grassland pDT") and link them to the model description
* The generated ROCrate files were included on B2Share so they have their own Persistent Identifier, e.g. http://hdl.handle.net/11304/23a8d7d8-07bb-4405-a01b-96efa3bb09b0
