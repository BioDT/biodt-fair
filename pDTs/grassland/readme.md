## FAIRness of the Grasslands pDT

This page features information about how the BioDT project made the Grassmind model (https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=48444) as well as its input data Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable

Steps to do it:
* Publishing the input datasets on B2Share (https://b2share.eudat.eu/records/?q=keywords.keyword%3D%27BioDT%20AND%20Grassland%20pDT%27&size=100)
* Writing a script to automatically generate ROCrates
* Include the ROCrate files on B2Share so they have their own Persistent Identifier
