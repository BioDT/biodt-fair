The Biodiversity Digital Twin (BioDT) project is at the forefront of innovation, offering advanced simulation and prediction models to tackle critical global biodiversity challenges. This cutting-edge project is designed to address complex biodiversity dynamics through practical use cases, providing invaluable insights and tools for conservation and restoration efforts.

BioDT harnesses the computational power of the [LUMI Supercomputer](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/), one of the fastest and most powerful computing systems in the world. By integrating FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles with state-of-the-art digital infrastructure, predictive modelling, and AI solutions, BioDT facilitates the development of precise and reliable models. These models are crucial for creating evidence-based strategies aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity on a global scale.

## The BioDT Prototype

The first [Biodiversity Digital Twin prototype](https://app.biodt.eu/app/biodtshiny) is now publicly available, marking a significant milestone in the BioDT project's development. This prototype is designed to address critical biodiversity management challenges, offering a practical and innovative tool for conservation efforts. Initially, the prototype focuses on assessing honey bee performance in Germany, providing actionable insights into factors affecting colony health and productivity.

By leveraging the dynamic and large-scale model-data fusion characteristic of Digital Twins, BioDT ensures continuous model improvement and re-calibration. This process involves identifying and addressing mismatches between model predictions and real-world data, particularly in relation to specific land use types and climatic conditions. The goal is to enhance the realism and accuracy of the models, ultimately leading to better-informed conservation strategies.

## Research Infrastructures

BioDT collaborates with leading [biodiversity research infrastructures](https://biodt.eu/research-infrastructures), including DiSSCo, eLTER, GBIF, and LifeWatch. These entities facilitate data collection, collation, storage, and provision, making it easier for researchers to access and utilise high-quality data.

## Alignment with Key Policy Initiatives

BioDT is designed to respond to several key EU and international policy initiatives, ensuring that its outputs are aligned with broader environmental and sustainability goals. These initiatives include:

-   [EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en): A comprehensive plan to protect and restore biodiversity across the EU.
-   [EU Green Deal](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en): An ambitious framework aiming to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent.
-   [UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals): A global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030.
-   [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/): An initiative to develop a high-precision digital model of the Earth to monitor and simulate natural and human activity.

## Future Prospects

As the BioDT project continues to evolve, it promises to play a pivotal role in driving evidence-based solutions for biodiversity protection and restoration across Europe. By combining cutting-edge technology with a commitment to sustainability, BioDT is poised to make a significant impact on global biodiversity conservation efforts.

The ongoing development and refinement of the Biodiversity Digital Twin will enable researchers, policymakers, and conservationists to make more informed decisions, leading to more effective and sustainable biodiversity management practices. BioDT represents a new era in biodiversity research and conservation, where technology and data-driven insights pave the way for a healthier and more resilient planet.
