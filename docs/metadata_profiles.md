This section offers additional information and guidance for the different RO-Crate metadata profiles developed during the project:

-   [Kernel Attributes]({{ '/metadata_profiles/kernel' | relative_url }}) cover all the general information that is common to any digital object. While they are described independently here, they don't constitute a separate profile themselves, and instead are present in all of the other profiles.
-   [Dataset]({{ '/metadata_profiles/dataset' | relative_url }}) is used to describe the data sources, either as discrete datasets or continuous data streams that keep being updated with newer data.
-   [Model]({{ '/metadata_profiles/model' | relative_url }}) is a computational representation of a problem or a process that can be executed to simulate, solve, or analyse the behaviour of a system. Typically, they depend on one or multiple datasets for an accurate representation.
-   [Workflow]({{ '/metadata_profiles/workflow' | relative_url }}) captures multi-step methods involving different tools to collect, process and analyse data, which typically result in a certain output.
-   [Mapping Set]({{ '/metadata_profiles/mapping_set' | relative_url }}) represents a set of individual mappings between certain terms, typically describing the translation between two particular semantic artefacts.
