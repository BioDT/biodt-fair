    "Within BioDT, there is a wide variety of datasets and data sources at different levels of FAIR. While the overarching goal and benefits of turning them into FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) might already be clear, *how* exactly to get there is definitely not. This and other future notebooks aim at tackling that issue by providing concrete examples of how to increase the level of FAIRness of existing datasets, data sources and other digital objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a step-by-step guide on how to turn an existing dataset into an RO-Crate, creating appropriate metadata in the process. Part of this is taken from the [RO-Crate Documentation](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), using the most recent version of the RO-Crate specification (version 1.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the same example as in the [FAIR Guidelines for the use cases](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/x/EiWqEg), we'll use one of the data sources listed by the use case [4.1.3.1 Invasive species](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/x/ibZzEQ), namely *\"D4: Maps for 7 ecosystem services (Table 1. Overview of available data)\"* from the sub-page [Alien Plant Species Dynamics](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/x/OsoTEg). The dataset can be downloaded from the page following this link: [EU Ecosystem Assessment - Invasive Alien Species](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset/f11838ff-8984-4284-bea5-e0a11d9f8d2f).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is that this can be replicated with other similar datasets. For simplicity, we're assuming that the dataset is represented by a directory (which only contains the dataset files). Examples of other formats (like HDF5), types of data (e.g. data streams) and other types of digital objects (models, workflows, software) will be added in later sections or separate notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: the FDO specifications are technology independent, and therefore, different tools and formats can be used to achieve them. RO-Crate is one of the possible realisations of FDOs and is used here as an example. However, it is not compulsory to use them from the BioDT FAIR point of view, and examples of other technologies will also be provided. The takeaway message should be about what is achieved in terms of FAIRness thanks to metadata.*"

    "[RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/introduction.html) is a method for aggregating and describing research data with associated metadata.

    "Any included file must have the `\"@id\"` field with the path relative to \\<RO-Crate root\\> but also `\"@type\"` where `\"File\"` must be included (or `\"Dataset\"`, for directories).\n",
    "Other details (`\"description\"`, `\"crs\"`, `\"spatialCoverage\"`, `\"encodingFormat\"`...) have been filled in by manual inspection of the files or from the `readme.txt`. To represent the \"Extent\" information fround on the `\"readme.txt\"` file, we included the metadata field `\"spatialCoverage\"` from the [RO-Crate 1.1 context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/context.jsonld) (the units might not be in a correct format, though). `\"crs\"` and `\"resolution\"` are completely made up since we couldn't find a suitable definition on the [RO-Crate 1.1 context](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/context.jsonld). This leads to not fully complying with principle I2, and not achieving R1.3:\n",

    "> <span style=\"color:#0072B2\">I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:#D55E00\">R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it is a first step, and better than nothing. After looking into what (or if) community standards exist for this type of data, possibly in other domain-specific repositories, the metadata can be updated accordingly. This leads to a related issue...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What level of detail and depth is necessary?\n",
    "Datasets can contain thousands of files within many levels of depth. It is obviously unfeasible to include all of them in the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file, and indeed, it is not strictly necessary to include them as part of `ro-crate-metadata.json` for a valid RO-Crate implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, an RO-Crate should be self-describing and self-contained, and thus only the *necessary* information to describe a dataset should be added (the rest is optional). But then, where to draw the line between what is necessary and what is not? Concerning this guide, what's necessary depends on the nature of the dataset being worked on and is left to the judgement of the researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the ultimate goal is to achieve a FAIR Digital Object implementation, for which clear and concise specifications on what is necessary to include should be procided (for example, in terms of metadata). Since the FDO specifications are still work in progress, more information about the minimum required metadata and similar aspects will be provided soon as part of the BioDT FAIR guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, we can say that the principles F2 and R1 are, at best, only partially achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:#0072B2\">F2. Data are described with rich metadata</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:#0072B2\">R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, because of the structure of the metadata file, it is clear which information refers to what data. Each contextual or data entity has an entry in the `\"@graph\"`, and all metadata (including other linked contextual/data entities) can be found or referenced from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:#009E73\">F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note that they are relative paths instead of globally unique, persistent and resolvable identifiers, but that is covered by principle F1).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finishing up. What's next?\n",
    "This was a first pass aimed at collecting and organising some basic information in the form of an RO-Crate metadata file. As you can see, an important part of achieving FAIR revolves around having structured metadata and following certain community standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's still much more to do:\n",
    "- Some FAIR principles have not been tackled yet, mainly those concerning where the (meta)data will live and how it will be accessed (F4, A1, A1.1, A1.2, A2), but also regarding references to other (meta)data (I3) and provenance information (R1.2). Those are strongly dependent on the scientific domain and would require guides of their own, and so are left unconsidered here.\n",
    "- Particularly, the entries for data entities (files and directories) could be greatly extended with more information describing scientific aspects that were overlooked here for simplicity and lack of domain expertise.\n",
    "- There's also the packaging format. A simple way would be to bundle the RO-Crate as a ZIP file, but there are many other options. For example, [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) and [BagIT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8493/) are more advanced options.\n",
    "- After packaging the RO-Crate, it should be uploaded to an appropriate repository and given its own persistent identifier (PID). Again, that's out of the scope for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, there are plenty of other cases in terms of data sources, but also workflows, models, software... More materials will be uploaded regularly covering all those cases. Last but not least, below you can find the resulting FAIRness status."

    "## Appendix: Using language-specific libraries and other tools\n",
    "There are some tools and libraries that could be used to avoid creating the RO-Crate and writing the `ro-crate-metadata.json` file manually. For a list of other available tools, visit the [documentation](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools/) ([JSON-LD's documentation](https://json-ld.org/#developers) might also list some useful tools, but beware that those have a greater scope than RO-Crates and are probably more complex). Most of them are still fairly recent and need to mature. To highlight a couple of them:\n",
    "- [Describo Online](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/describo-online/): a browser-based application to create and update RO-Crates. It provides a Graphical User Interface to fill in the metadata and browse the content of the crate.\n",
    "- [Describo desktop](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/describo/): the desktop application of Describo. Its development is not so active anymore.\n",
    "- [`ro-crate-py`](https://github.com/researchobject/ro-crate-py): a Python module that provides some basic functionality to create and manage RO-Crates directly from Python scripts (and also a command line interface), however, it's still at an early stage and documentation is lacking. Example usage can be found below.\n",
    "- [dataspice](https://docs.ropensci.org/dataspice/): an R package for creating basic metadata files for datasets by editing CSV files. The result is not quite a valid RO-Crate (notably filenames are missing), but kind of 80% there."
