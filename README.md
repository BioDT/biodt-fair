# BioDT - FAIR tutorials and materials
This repository hosts some materials concerning the FAIR aspect of the data, software, and other digital objects within the Biodiversity Digital Twin (BioDT) project.

## Content
Currently, there is only a single Jupyter Notebook example: 
- `dataset_ro-crate.ipynb`: It goes over how to turn an existing dataset into an RO-Crate, with descriptions on the main elements of RO-Crate and how some FAIR principles are achieved. To check it out, simply click on the file and go through the text.
