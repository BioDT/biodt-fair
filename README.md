# BioDT - FAIR tutorials and materials
This repository hosts some materials concerning the FAIR aspect of the data, software, and other digital objects within the Biodiversity Digital Twin (BioDT) project.

## Content
Currently, there is only a couple of Jupyter Notebook examples: 
- `dataset_ro-crate.ipynb`: It goes over how to turn an existing dataset into an RO-Crate, with descriptions on the main elements of RO-Crate and how some FAIR principles are achieved. To check it out, simply click on the file and go through the text.
- `fdo_examples_basic.ipynb`: Short illustration of what FDOs can enable within BioDT, developed as an example for the MS26 milestone. To be further extended with more content (e.g. an RO-Crate example for collection records).

To support the previous notebooks, there is another Python file with a very preliminary definition of an FDO. This will be further developed as the project progresses to reflect our understanding of how FDOs can function within BioDT.
- `fdo_definitions.py`: Example class definitions of FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) classes for the BioDT project.
